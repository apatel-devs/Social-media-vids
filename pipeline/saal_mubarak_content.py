@dharmalockapp — Saal Mubarak / Bestu Varas, Vikram Samvat 2083. 2026-11-10.

THE HOOK
Avi's brief: a new year post about accomplishing goals, with a hook that is
relatable but pulls the viewer in. His own sketch was a struck-through "I
will accomplish nothing" corrected into resolutions. That shape lives on the
Omni cut (pipeline/omni_saal_mubarak.py). Here it is pointed at the one
object every single viewer actually has: the resolution list still sitting in
their notes app from last year.

Relatable, slightly uncomfortable, and true - which is what makes someone
stop. The turn is that the list was never the hard part.

FACT CHECK
  * Saal Mubarak / Nutan Varshabhinandan is the Gujarati New Year greeting,
    and the year beginning is Vikram Samvat 2083 - confirmed on hindutone's
    Bestu Varas 2026 page.
  * Gita 6.25 verified at shlokam.org/gita/gita-6-25.htm.
  * Gita 3.35 verified at shlokam.org/gita/gita-3-35.htm.

  NO DATE IS PRINTED, deliberately. Bestu Varas splits across the date line
  this year: hindutone's USA page puts it Monday 9 November, Drik Panchang
  for New Delhi puts it Tuesday 10 November, because the deciding Kartik
  Shukla Pratipada morning falls on different civil days. Saying "today"
  would be wrong for half the audience, so the copy greets the year without
  dating it.
